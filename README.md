The [CloudFormation Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudformation-cli.html) is an open-source tool that enables you to develop and test AWS and third-party resources and register them for use in AWS CloudFormation. Begin by going to the [documentation guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-setup.html) and setting up your build environment.


## Examples
This example resource is built in the following languages:

- Go

- Python

- TypeScript

- Java (Comming soon)

## Getting started
- Once you have set up your development environment, obtain a CrudCrud API key. Don't worry; the free version provides more than enough requests to play with this example.

- Pick one of the language examples for this repo.
- Add the API key to the source file.

    - (Python) ![Architecture](images/python.png)
    - (TypeScript) ![Architecture](images/typescript.png)

- Submit the resource using the Cloudformation CLI
- After the provider has been registered, deploy it using the sample Cloudformation `cloudformation.json`

## Contract test
This example was create using Cloudformation's best practices. Therefore, it will pass all of the Cloudformation CLI's Contract test.
To run the contract test, follow the directions in the
[documentation.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation-cli/latest/userguide/resource-type-cli-test.html)
